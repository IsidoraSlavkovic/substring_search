Here you can find C++ implementations of the following substring search algorithms:

- brute force
- Boyer-Moore
- Rabin-Karp
- KMP
- Z algorithm

Written using [gflags](https://github.com/gflags/gflags) and
[abseil-cpp](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp), tested
with [gtest](https://github.com/google/googletest) and built with
[bazel.build](https://bazel.build/).

This is a somewhat refurbished part of my high school graduation project/paper.
